My game is based on the TV show Buffy the Vampire Slayer. In it, the player picks a main character (Buffy, Willow, Xander, or Giles) to play
as and tries to collect ingredients to stop the apocalypse. The player goes to different locations to obtain the ingredients. At the first
location, the Magic Shop, the player has to solve a riddle to obtain one ingredient. They can also get hints about where to go to get the
other ingredients, but some choices will result in a game over. At the second location, the cemetery, the player has to fight a vampire using
skills specific to the character they chose. At the third, the catacombs, they have to fight a demon similarly. The player gets an ingredient
after they defeat each monster. Finally, when the player has all three ingredients, they go to the Hellmouth and stop the apocalypse to win.
